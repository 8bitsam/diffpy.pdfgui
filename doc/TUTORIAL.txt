Lesson 1:  Creating simple fit of Ni PDF

  Input files:

    tests/testdata/Ni_2-8.chi.gr    experimental X-ray PDF data
    tests/testdata/Ni.stru          Ni f.c.c. structure in PDFfit format

  Procedure:

    1.  Open a terminal and type "pdfgui" to start the program.

    2.  Create a new Fit:
        (a) Select "FITTING" in the left-most vertical tab.
        (b) Click right mouse button in the left panel and choose "New Fit" in
            the pop-up menu.

    3.  Load structure model:

        (a) Place the cursor of the mouse onto the title of the Fit, click
            the right button and choose "Insert Phase" in the pop-up menu.
        (b) Click the "Open" button and load the Ni.stru file.

        The right panel has 3 tabs for the initial configuration, constraints
        panel for expressing structure properties as functions of tunable
        parameters, and Results panel for refined structure.

    4.  Load experimental PDF data:
        (a) Select the title of "Fit 1", click the right button and choose
            "Insert Data Set" in the pop-up menu.
        (b) Load the "Ni_2-8.chi.gr" file.

        Again, the right panel shows 3 tabs for properties of this dataset.

    5.  Define what is refined:
        (a) Click on the "Ni_2-8.chi.gr" data and select the "Constraints" tab.
        (b) Type "@1" into "Scale Factor" edit box.
        (c) Select the "Ni.stru" phase and its "Constraints" tab.
        (d) Fill "a", "b", "c" boxes with "@5".

        A refined variable can be expressed as math expression
        f(@n1, @n2, @n3, ...) where
            @n1  stands for fitted parameter and
            n1, n2, ...   are arbitrary positive integers
        This allows simple linking of related variables - for example, since
        cell lengths a, b, c are all expressed as "@5", the refined structure
        will remain cubic.

    6.  Start the refinement:
        (a) Select "Fit 1" in the left panel.  The parameters panel shows list
            of used parameters and their initial values.
        (b) Click the "gear" icon on the toolbar and watch the fit progress
            in the terminal window.

    7.  Plot the results:
        (a) Select "PLOTTING" in the left-most vertical tab.
        (b) Select the "Ni_2-8.chi.gr" dataset
        (c) Click the desired Y data (to select more, hold "Shift" or "Ctrl").
        (d) Click "Plot" button.

        A new window pops up with plots.  You can try out the buttons in
        the toolbar below.

    8.  Save your project for later use.

Lesson 2:  Build structure model using crystal symmetry

  In the previous example the initial structure was defined by an existing
  file.  However, PDFgui makes it very easy to build structure model from
  scratch and constrain it with arbitrary crystal symmetry.

    1.  Create blank structure:
        (a) Click the FITTING tab
        (b) Repeat steps 1-3a from Lesson 1, but choose the "New" button.
            Rename "New Phase" to "Ni fcc".

    2.  Define asymmetric unit:
        (a) Right click the header of the empty atoms grid in the "Configure" page.
        (b) Insert 1 atom using the popup menu.
        (c) Change the elem cell to "Ni".
        (d) Select the u11-u33 cells and type "0.004" and press Enter.

    3.  Expand to all equivalent positions:
        (a) Right click the first Ni atom and select "Expand space group". A
            "Space Group Expansion" dialog should open.
        (b) In the dialog, select Fm-3m or just type 225 in the "Space Group"
            box and and hit "OK".
        (c) You should now have four atoms in the atoms grid.

    4.  Generate symmetry constraints:
        (a) Select the "Constraints" tab.
        (b) Select all atoms. This can be done by dragging the mouse over the
            atom names or by clicking on the "elem" header.
        (c) Right click in a selected cell and select "Symmetry constraints."  A
            "Space Group Constraints" dialog should open.
        (d) "Fm-3m" should already appear in the "Space Group" box. If it does
            not, select it as you did in step 3 and hit "OK".
        (e) The u11-u33 cells should all read the same value.

    5. Continue the fit as in Lesson 1.
